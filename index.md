## Welcome to A to Z programming

Here you can find fun games such as [Snake Battle Royale](https://atozprogramming.github.io/CompactStandardSnake.html), a 3-player free-for-all competition to kill other snakes while targeting apples, all the while the board shrinks. As of now, no games or projects on this website utalize the cloud to provide online multiplayer games, so playing face-to-face will be common.

### Game List

Instructions are included for each game, along with the page link. Have fun!

#### Snake Battle Royale
The most popular game, [Snake Battle Royale](https://atozprogramming.github.io/CompactStandardSnake.html) pits you and 2 other players against each other as you all race for apples. It should also be kept in mind that a computer snake also competes.
###### Scoring
The objective of the game is to score the most pointsby the time all the snakes die. Every apple you eat is worth one point, and there is a bonus 2-point reward for the player who survives the longest. Keep in mind that the snake that survives the longest may not win, as s/he may have not eaten enough apples to surpass the other players.
###### Controls
Player1 (Blue) controls with the arrow keys

Player2 (Red) controls with the WASD keys

Player3 (Green) controls with the IJKL keys

Player4 (Yellow) is a computer, and thus has no keyboard controls.

Before the game begins, there is a 3-ish second countdown. If you press any of your control keys (other than right) before the game begins, you can toggle your skin. The skins are different for each player, and do not alter gameplay.

To restart the game, please refresh the page.
