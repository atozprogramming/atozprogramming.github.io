#### [Snake Battle Royale](./CompactStandardSnake.html)
![alt text](SnakeScreenshot.png "Snake")

The most popular game, Snake Battle Royale pits you and 2 other players against each other as you all race for apples. It should also be kept in mind that a computer snake also competes.
  * ##### Scoring
The objective of the game is to score the most points by the time all the snakes die. Every apple you eat is worth one point, and there is a bonus 2-point reward for the player who survives the longest. Keep in mind that the snake that survives the longest may not win, as s/he may have not eaten enough apples to surpass the other players.
  * ##### Controls
       * _**Player1**_ (Blue) controls with the arrow keys

       * _**Player2**_ (Red) controls with the WASD keys

       * _**Player3**_ (Green) controls with the IJKL keys

       * _**Player4**_ (Yellow) is a computer, and thus has no keyboard controls.
  * ##### Skins
One of the best features this game has to offer is that you can enable skins for your characters. Each Snake(Blue, Red, and Green) has their own unique skin that is exclusive only to them, encouraging play with different snakes between game rounds. in order to activate your skin, you must note that before the game begins, there is a 3-ish second countdown. If you press any of your control keys (other than your right key, be it the right arrow, "d", or "l") before the game begins, you can toggle your skin. The skins are different for each player, and do not alter gameplay.

To restart the game, simply refresh the page.

#### [3 kings](./3kingsBoardGame.html)
![alt text](3Kings.png "3kings")

Although Snake Battle Royale was released first on the website, this game was the first game on the entire website that was programmed. The instructions are provided in-game. 3 kings is a board game that plays the computer against you in a strategy game, with only 3 pieces per side, making piece sacrifices game-turning events. Can you stand your ground as the computer closes in on your home base?
  * ##### Tips
    * Pressing "0" at the start menu will have your turn be second
    * Pressing "T" will toggle the territory-viewing mode, which helps aid player strategies, showing the squared controlled by the player, the squares controlled by the computer, and contested squares.

#### [Snake Unlimited](./SnakeUnlimited.html)

For those who are bad at Snake Battle Royale and constantly die, this is the solution. Whenever a player dies, the are randomly teleported to the edge of the board, and continue playing normally. The board no longer shrinks, in order to produce large snakes that dominate the board. This timeless game does not end, but can still become competitive!
  * ##### Rules and Controls
    * See the rules for regular Snake Battle Royale.
  * ##### Changes
    * Players constantly respawn
    * The board does not shrink
    * Players that run into another snake increase the winning snake's length and score (though length boost is not as large as score boost)
#### More Games coming soon!

Always check back for updates!
