> This website is a long continuous project that is aiming on featuring`extrodinary games`that cannot be found elsewhere. This website has currently`1 game`, and will be increasing its game count periodically. In addition to games, we feature side-projects for`academic`and entertainment purposes, feel free to check them out!

## Game List

Instructions are included for each game, along with the game link. Enjoy the great games!

#### [Snake Battle Royale](./CompactStandardSnake.html)
The most popular game, Snake Battle Royale pits you and 2 other players against each other as you all race for apples. It should also be kept in mind that a computer snake also competes.
  * ###### Scoring
The objective of the game is to score the most pointsby the time all the snakes die. Every apple you eat is worth one point, and there is a bonus 2-point reward for the player who survives the longest. Keep in mind that the snake that survives the longest may not win, as s/he may have not eaten enough apples to surpass the other players.
  * ###### Controls
       * _**Player1**_ (Blue) controls with the arrow keys

       * _**Player2**_ (Red) controls with the WASD keys

       * _**Player3**_ (Green) controls with the IJKL keys

       * _**Player4**_ (Yellow) is a computer, and thus has no keyboard controls.

Before the game begins, there is a 3-ish second countdown. If you press any of your control keys (other than right) before the game begins, you can toggle your skin. The skins are different for each player, and do not alter gameplay.

To restart the game, simply refresh the page.

#### More Games coming soon!

Don't forget that all Yellow text are links to the different subpages, and remember to always check back for more games!
